solumDB version 0.0

== WHAT IT IS ==

* handles routing queries to the right connections
* handles reconnecting if server has gone away - very helpful for long running scripts
* only connects if it has to - so if you make a sweet caching setup and you dont need the db at 
  all it wont connect
* this is a db class made to be a drop in replacement for low performance orm nightmares
  if you have built all of your model logic in orm specific db class files i feel sorry for you =(

== WHAT IT IS NOT ==
